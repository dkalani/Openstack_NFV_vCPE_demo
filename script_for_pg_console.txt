# This is a text description of the steps that need to be taken to add a virtual CPE service using the PLUMgrid console
# on top of the NFV environment created with the scripts in this project.
# It describes the steps required to create the service including a NAT pool and adding the connectors to the physical device
# and in between the NFV and vCPE environments. It also describes how to add the physical device and remotely configure a home
# networking service on it.

- Log into PLUMgrid GUI. Default username/password is typically "plumgrid"/"plumgrid"

*** Zone Config --
- Add CPE-nat-metro-pool ; start 172.16.254.50, end 172.16.254.254

- Configure OSPF in routers
*
-- Select the router "zPG_dynamic_NFV-rtr-in"
router_ID: 172.16.2.254
networks:
172.16.2.0
255.255.255.0
0.0.0.0
redistribute connected
*
-- Select the router "zPG_dynamic_NFV-rtr-out"
router_ID: 172.16.1.1
networks:
172.16.1.0
255.255.255.0
0.0.0.0
redistribute connected and static

- Right-click on the canvas and select [ Deploy ] to make the changes active

--> Show that OSPF is working across "SDN" and "Cloud" VNF
   * check the routing Database of the dynamic router purple icons and watch how routes are propagated
   * open up the vRouter appliance in openstack, login with "vyos"/"vyos" and run "show ip ospf neighbor"

** Zone config

- Add "vCPE-253" Virtual Domain:
-- Connector,
--- Mark External connectivity
--- Add instance
    * Port, "Home-WLAN", label pg-cpe+wlan0
    * Wire, "vCPE-253_to_NFV", (target "NFV")

-- NAT,
--- CPE-253-NAT
    * select from CPE-NAT-metro-pool, manually select 172.16.254.253

** Virtual Domain View
- Add topology "vCPE-HOMENET"
-- Add connector "Home-WLAN"
-- Add bridge "Home-NET"
-- Add router "Home-Router"
--- connect the router with the bridge
--- add IP address 192.168.1.1
-- Add NAT "CPE-253-NAT"
--- connect the NAT with the router:
---- zone "inside":
---- IP address **** 172.16.254.50
[Deploy]

-- Add DNS
--- connect DNS to bridge "Home-NET":
---- IP address: 192.168.1.2
---- GW address: 192.168.1.1
----- Edit the DNS:
------ Forwarders: 8.8.8.8
------ Max cache size: 1024
------ Zone Attributes:
------- Domain name: "vcpe.local"
------- TTL: 38400
------- email address: "admin.vcpe.local"
------- nameserver: "dns.vcpe.local"
[Deploy]

-- Add DHCP:
--- connect DHCP to bridge "Home-DHCP"
---- IP address: 192.168.1.3
---- IP Pool start: 192.168.1.50
---- IP Pool end: 192.168.1.60
---- configure DHCP options by clicking on the interface (DOT/circle) between the DHCP server and the bridge:
----- router: 192.168.1.1
----- dns-server: 192.168.1.2
[Deploy]

-- Add Connector "vCPE-253_to-NFV"
--- connect Connector to "NAT"
---- zone "outside"
[Deploy]

*** Go back to "NFV" Virtual Domain
*** Drag and drop a connector from the top bar:
   - select Connector "vCPE253_to_NFV"
   - connect Connector to "METRO_net" bridge
[Deploy]

--> Show that the solution is working
  * Go to "Virtual Domain View", click on "vCPE-253" topology, right-click on the "home-NET" bridge and select "Dynamic Mac stats". Right-click again and select "Host Table stats"
    - These windows will show the new terminals as they connect

--> Connect a terminal to the physical WiFi Access Point
  * SSID = "00PLUMGRID"
  * Security WEP
  * Password = 1357924680

  --> Watch how the new terminal is connected to the internet through the wifi
  --> Watch how the traffic of the new terminal is flowing through the virtual router VNF in the cloud
      - Log into the vRouter VNF again in Openstack
      - run the command "tshark -i eth0"
         - CTRL-C when done

--> Add a static DNS entry for "Captive Portal"
* Go to "Virtual Domain View", click on "vCPE-253" topology, right-click on the DNS and "Edit":
------ Static Records, Add:
------- Hostname "home"
------- Data: 172.16.2.100
        (this should be the ip address of the webserver VNF in openstack, it's been set by the installation script)
        (to double check it: log into openstack, open the console of the webserver, log in with "root"/"root123" and run "ifconfig eth1")


--> Use the connected terminal to open "http://home.vcpe.local" and watch the captive portal
