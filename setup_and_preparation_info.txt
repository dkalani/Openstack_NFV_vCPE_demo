# This file includes notes on preliminary work that may need to be performed on an Openstack cloud
# to be able to run this demo. This assumes a working Openstack installation with the PLUMgrid plugin and
# solution installed and working properly

** 1.- Set up Appliance flag on PLUMgrid
### file: etc/neutron/plugins/plumgrid/plumlib.ini
[PLUMgridLibrary]
# PLUMlib writes to CDB to save some data. If this flag is set to
# false, PLUMlib will not use CDB utility
cdb_configuration = True
# Name of the interface plugged on fabric network
fabric_eth = eth1
# Security Policy Flag
enable_pg_security = True
# Flag to enable/disable virtual appliance creation
vapp_flag = True

[keystone_authtoken]
auth_uri=http://20.0.0.2:35357/v2.0
admin_password=changeme
admin_user=admin
admin_tenant_name=admin

[PLUMgridMetadata]
nova_metadata_ip=169.254.169.254
metadata_proxy_shared_secret=changeme
metadata_mode=local
enable_pg_metadata=True
nova_metadata_port=8775

### EOF
# Save and exit.
# Restart the Neutron service with "sudo service neutron-server restart"

** 2.- If Kilo or older plugin version, add the extraroute extension to the neutron plugin
### file: /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/neutron/plugins/plumgrid/plumgrid_plugin/plumgrid_plugin.py
## Add "extraroute" on line 21:

supported_extension_aliases = ["binding", "external-net", "extraroute",
                                   "provider", "quotas", "router",
                                   "security-group"] + vndr_exts

## EOF

** 3.- Configure the "nfvrc" file with the values according to the installation:
** Edit the nfvrc file and modify the values in the first paragraph under "PARAMETERS TO BE ADJUSTED FOR NEW INSTALLATIONS"

** 4.- Make sure that the Openstack credencitals in the nfvrc file are valid and the same as the "openrc" file downloaded from Openstack.
** check with ". ./nfvrc; glance image-list
**** depending on the install, it may be required to change the Openstack credentials section too. Particularly, the URL type
**** from "publicURL" to "internalURL"

** 4.- Always keep all files in this package in the same subdirectory, including the VNF image files
